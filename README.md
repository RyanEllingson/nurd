# Game Realm


## Description 
The Game Realm application is used to locate local or digital groups of people to play games ranging from tabletop rpg's to popular video games. Game Realm is an all in one Network of players from every type of game. Not only can you find a group to play games you already know you can also find groups from other games being played at lower level to try them out and maybe find a new favorite! Game Realm Does things differently, once you've created an account and have participated in a group or played a game with someone you can be given an endorsement from them! These will give your account more credibility and show that you are a goodsport or a good teammate!  

## User Story
As a gamer I would like to find local groups of games that I play. I would also like to be able to see endorsements of other users aswell as specified paramaters such as gender to find a game environement that will be comfortable and inviting.
